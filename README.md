This program was created as a result of a housemate showing me a Rabbit R1. I created my own very slow version as a proof of concept using a webdriver, meta llamas, and webscraping skills. It is slow and makes occaisonal mistakes but it did win a race against the Rabbit R1 on a few queries. Overall, this was a fun evening project.
